**What This Session is About**

You've made commits with 'git add' and 'git commit', but have you ever wondered what is actually happening when you run these commands? Git commands come in two flavors, porcelain commands like 'git add' and plumbing commands like 'git update-index'. In this session, you will learn how to amaze your friends using only Git plumbing commands to handle common tasks in Git. This session will be most enjoyable for intermediate to advanced Git users.
